# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
# For practice, write this code inside a function.

a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
b = []
def listEnds():
    return(b.append(a[0], a[len(a)-1]))
